The main goal of VERun is to run your program with just one command without leaving vim. You just open the file you want to run and execute :VERun.

Main features included in version 0.9:
- Runs C/C++, php, python, bash/sh and makefiles with just one command, without needing to cd your dir nor configuring anything
- Auto detect your C/C++ headers and adds the links to the g++ command (see :h VECppAutoHeaderList)
- Auto detect your python version
- Option to execute your program in an external terminal
- Currently supports only C/C++, php, python, bash/sh and makefiles

To compile/run your program, run:
	:VERun

For further instructions and configuration check the help file included in the tar ball.
